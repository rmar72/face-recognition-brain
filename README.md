note to self: master branch is no longer needed, site hosted on gh-pages branch, & origin develop branch is now up to date with code that got lost in the master branch(react build, wrong place to add code). However, my develop branch reflects the same code as master, ...?!

1) git subtree push --prefix build origin gh-pages

2) now good for, git push origin develop
